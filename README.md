Goal and Progression
====================
### Goal: Get 25 Ship Part ($${\color{red}not \space inclued \space Ship \space Part \space Optional}$$)

List of Item :

Pikmin :
- $${\color{yellow}Yellow \space Pikmin}$$
- $${\color{blue}Blue \space Pikmin}$$


Areas Acces :
- The Impact Site Revisit
- The Forest of Hope
- The Forest of Navel
- The Distant Spring
- The Final Trial

Other:
- Ship Part (25 max)
- Ship Part Optional (5 max)
- Pikpik Carrot (Filler)

List of Type Location :
- Discover Onion
- Ship Part
- 100% Area (After having made all the other check / location)
- Achievements (Grow x number "color" Pikmin & Pikmin in Bloom & firework)
- Visit & Re Explore & Crash on PNF-404
- S. S. Dolphin Upgrade
- Break Wall & Blast Wall & Build Bridge & Push Box

Progression: All areas except The Impact Site have to be obtained from the pool to be traveled to. Yellow and Blue Pikmin are in the item pool and can't be used until received. Intention is to start on a new save file, but you can start on a Day 2 file if you want to save time (just don't forget to mark off the Day 1 checks). 

Note: This is intended for the Gamecube version of Pikmin. I have not tested the below codes for the Wii version (don't have a way to at the moment), but I'm thinking they're for the Gamecube version only. 

Important Note: You will need to enable the "All Areas Open" code for the logic to work appropriately. Here is the AR code itself if you need to activate it manually:

### 04CE586D 08000000 ###
### 0439D980 0000001F ###

Another Note: It's somewhat possible that you might need to use an infinite Day code (always Day x) if you have to swap around areas a lot. Hopefully this wouldn't be a problem. Here's the AR Code for "Always Day 29" in case it's needed (just use it if you get to Day 29 without reaching your goal): 

### 04CE587B 08000000 ###
### 0039DAB7 0000001D ###

Total Checks: 128
